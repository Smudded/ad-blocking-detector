Hi John,

Ad Blocking Detector isn't working correctly.

My shortcodes do not display the appropriate content when an blockers are enabled. I have
visited the demo page on the plugin website as instructed, and the demo works.  I do not 
use any performance plugins at this time.

Answers to the questions:

Does a simple shortcode work?
    Yes. If I create a shortcode with only simple text, it works.
What ad blocker do you use?
	AdGuard: https://extensions.apple.com/details/?id=com.adguard.safari-N33TQXN8C7
What theme?
	A modified child theme of Simple Catch. The modifications are very minor.
What specifically is wrong?
	When the ad blocker is enabled, my no ad blocker detected content does not show up.


INFORMATION:

Operating System and Web Browser:
Apple OS X and Safari
