Hi John,

I recently installed your plugin, Ad Blocking Detector, on my WordPress website, and encountered a problem.

Whenever I click the "Get Shortcode" button on the Manage Shortcodes tab, nothing happens.  Per the instructions on the Report a Problem tab, here are the answers to the questions and included info:

QUESTIONS:

What am I clicking?
    Get Shortcode button on Manage Shortcodes tab.
What does nothing mean specifically?
	Literally nothing.  Nothing happens at all.
Have I noticed similar behavior elsewhere?
	Nope. Only this button, only in your plugin.
Does this problem occur in a different web browser too?
	Yes.  Tried in Chrome and Firefox on my Windows desktop.


INFORMATION:

Operating System and Web Browser
	Microsoft Windows 10, Google Chrome (latest update)
