Don't let ad blocker wielding visitors see a blank space. This plugin will display alternative content if ad blocking is detected.

== Description ==
= Ad Blocking Detector =
This plugin allows you to specify two alternative sections of content.  One for normal visitors, 
and the other for visitors using common ad blocking software, such as the popular Adblock Plus.  Don't let
those ad blockers take away your revenue stream!

This plugin works by creating shortcodes which check for active ad blockers and displays the appropriate content 
you specify.

You can use this to display different ads that don't get flagged by ad blockers, substitute other content like
newsletter signup forms, show pleas to disable ad blockers, and much more.


Ad Blocking Detector works with all popular web browsers, including mobile browsers, and all popular ad blocking browser extensions/add-ons.

== Installation ==
1. Upload the `adblock-detector` directory to your `wp-content/plugins` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" menu in your admin section.
1. Visit the newly added "Adblock" menu in your admin section to get started.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= How can I use a shortcode in sidebar widget? =
By default, WordPress does not parse shortcodes in widgets.  You must enable that functionality manually.
You can find instructions from the folks at WPBeginner.com 
[here](http://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-use-shortcodes-in-your-wordpress-sidebar-widgets/).

The short version is you must add the following code to your theme's *functions.php* file:
`add_filter('widget_text', 'do_shortcode');`

This enables shortcode parsing in the "text" widget.


= How does this plugin treat visitors with Javascript disabled? =
At this time, this plugin does not treat disabled Javascript as an ad blocker.  
However, this plugin requires Javascript to *detect* ad blocking plugins.  If the visitor has Javascript
disabled, the plugin will not know whether the user has an ad blocker or not.
Therefore, if Javascript is disabled, the plugin display the content used
for normal visitors with no ad blockers.


= Does this plugin prevent visitors with an ad blocker from visiting my site or in any other way obscure the content? =
No.  In an indirect and inefficient way, you *can* obscure large portions of content from visitors using this plugin,
but that is not what it was designed to do.


= Why doesn't this plugin detect the _______________ ad blocker? =
Not all ad blockers operate the same way.  This plugin was tested with the most common ad blockers, but it is
possible that some ad blockers use different techniques for disabling ads than we are detecting.  If you find an
ad blocker we aren't detecting, [contact us](http://adblockingdetector.jtmorris.net/contact/) and let us know the ad blocker, 
web browser, and operating system you are using.  We will then investigate the problem.


= Can this plugin integrate with ad rotation plugins? =
This plugin recognizes shortcodes.  Some ad rotation plugins, like the popular *[Ad Rotate](http://wordpress.org/plugins/adrotate/)* plugin
display collections of rotating ads using shortcodes.  You can use the shortcode generated by other plugins inside *Ad Block Detector*, allowing you
to display rotating ads while harnessing the power of ad block detection.  You can find more information at the plugin's website: (http://adblockingdetector.jtmorris.net/display-rotating-ads/)


== Screenshots ==
1. Example of the administration backend.
2. Example of behavior in a WordPress post with one of the sample shortcodes.
